- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @james

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently switching to Crater and was looking for some help with adding Suppliers to the setup.
- the easy'st way is to add them as customers and have a custom field added to show that they are Debtors or creditors
- that part was easy to figure out.

the part i'm concerned about is how do i search for them in the client fields search
how do we change one of the fields in the search area of the clients page so we could have one of the custom fields ?

or how to at least edit a field
